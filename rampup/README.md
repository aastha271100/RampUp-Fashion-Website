 <p align="center">
With a passion for fashion here's my very own custom website relating to it.💃
 </p>
 
 
 <p align="center">
 The template is for the Online Clothing Fashion which includes trending wardrobe collection. The website is made from scratch 🥳 and doesn't include any readymade code.
Merlin Fashion doesn't include anything related to database, it is just a HTML, CSS and JS template. Though you can find some familiar images used in the website taken from various sources, but the purpose is to only make it more beautiful.🖤
